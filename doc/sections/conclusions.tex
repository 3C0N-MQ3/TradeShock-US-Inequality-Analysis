    \frametitle{Conclusion}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item As in the original paper, we estimate 2SLS regressions, but with composition adjustment.  
        
        \item This leads to a more pronounced impact on regional inequality than in the original paper.
        
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is particularly evident when examining wages as an example.
            
            \item The China shock reduces employment, leading to the displacement of low-wage workers into unemployment and non-participation.
            
            \item At first glance, this displacement may appear to increase wages, especially if we do not apply composition adjustments.
