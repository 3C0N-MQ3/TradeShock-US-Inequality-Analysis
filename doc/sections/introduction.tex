    \begin{block}{Research Question}
        What is the impact of a large international trade shock on inequality across regions in the US?
        How the increasing of Chinaâ€™s imports affected the US manufacturing employment?
        How those Commuting zones (CZs) that faced strong exposed import competition with China responded to rising Chinese import?
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Methodologic Approach}
        A composition-adjusting approach is applied to the outcomes using a Two-Stage Least Squares Regression Analysis. Potential changes in the composition of gender, age, education, race, and nativity (US-born) are held constant to assess demographic shifts across industries that may impact inequality.
